Title: Desktop friendly Memory and CPU monitor
Description: Physical and virtual memory monitor and CPU monitor. I've only catered for 1 cpu, but actually get the metrics for all CPUs (check ReturnCPUPercent(x) up to m_lCPUs). Sits conveniently on top of the desktop pretty unobtrusively too. if you like the progress bar, you can cut and paste the function into your own code. hope u find it useful.
