Getting Started.. 
So you want Q to your channel?.. Well there are a few things you need to do before anyone on #feds will add it. If you fail to follow the basic setup for getting Q as written below, you will only annoy the IRCops and reduce the chance of you getting Q in the future, so please follow these steps carefully.. 
  
Saying 'Hello' to Q..
First things first, you have to tell Q who you are - so it can recognise you in the future.

You do this by typing the following command:

/msg Q hello

You can verify that you have done this correctly by typing: /msg Q whois (your name here) (eg. /msg q whois John).

If you see a message back from Q that includes the line:
-Q(TheQBot@CServe.quakenet.eu.org)- John is indeed John.
..then you know you have said 'hello' correctly.



Change your Q password..
When you say 'hello' to Q, you will be assigned a password that you will need to use in the future in order to AUTH so that you can use Q's services.

This password, by default, is the same as your nick (eg. If 'John' did /msg q hello - then John's password would then be 'John') - which is why it is imperative that you change it right away. IRCops will have very little sympathy for people who complain about channel takeovers when it is revealed later on that the channel owner hasn't bothered to change their default password.

You can change your password by using the following command:

/msg Q newpass (new pass) (new pass) (for example, /msg q newpass notjohn notjohn).

Q will acknowledge a successful password change by displaying:
-Q(TheQBot@CServe.quakenet.eu.org)- OK, password changed. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
I've got Q, what now? 
Ok, so you've got Q to your channel, what now?..

First off you can check yourself to see that you are indeed the 'owner' on the channel by typing:

/msg Q chanlev (your channel) (your name)  ..eg. /msg q chanlev #johnschannel John

Assuming #johnschannel was the channel on which Q was placed, you would receive the following output:

-Q(TheQBot@CServe.quakenet.eu.org)- Known users on the channel are:
-Q(TheQBot@CServe.quakenet.eu.org)-          John     Modes: +amnov
-Q(TheQBot@CServe.quakenet.eu.org)- End of list.
 
  
How do I get auto-op ?
By default you will have auto-op (+a) already set, so as long as you have AUTH'd beforehand, you will automatically be given ops by Q when you join the channel. Q WILL NOT op you automatically unless you are AUTH'd. Additionally, if you disconnect from IRC or Q quits/rejoins after a netsplit, you will need to re-AUTH.

You can give other people auto-op by using the CHANLEV command (channel master(s)/owner only)

If you are a user on that channel and you want to get auto-op yourself, you will need to ask one of the channel master(s) or the owner to give you +ao. Do not ask IRCops to add these flags for you, because they will not. It is the responsibilty of the channel owner/masters to add, remove and otherwise maintain the user list on a given channel.

Commands available and what they do 
Here is a full list of commands available.
 
  
Hello 
The basic hello command.

Creates a new user for you on the bot. Note that there are *NO HOSTMASKS* on this bot. Other bots allow you to ident if you just know the password, so this one just uses the password and scraps the hostmask as pointless.

Usage:
/msg Q hello



AUTH 
Always auth when you sign on QuakeNet

This will identify you on the bot as until you next quit from IRC or are split from the bot.

Usage:
/msg Q@CServe.quakenet.org auth (your name) (your password) eg. /msg Q@CServe.quakenet.org auth John 8h2xkd



IDENT 
Identifies you as a particular user on the bot.

Identifies you to Q, use auth instead listed above.



HELP 
Gives full help on a particular bot command.

Usage:
/msg Q help (command) eg. /msg Q help op



SHOWCOMMANDS 
Lists all the commands on the bot.

Usage:
/msg Q showcommands



WHOAMI 
Gives the bot's opinion on who you are.

The bot should tell you your current global auth level (equivalent to the old #cservice levels) and may give other info too.

Usage:
/msg Q whoami



ADDUSER 
Add a user to a channel.

You should use CHANLEV to view/set the flags, but this command adds a user with default flags +aot

Usage:
/msg Q ADDUSER (#channel) (nick) Add AUTHED user. eg. /msg Q adduser #johnschannel John

/msg Q ADDUSER (#channel) (#nick) Add user (if not authed). eg. /msg Q adduser #johnschannel #John

Note: The nick parameter can also be given as #idnick where idnick is the nickname the person originally registered under.

You should use CHANLEV to view/set the flags, but this option removes all flags. (-abmnovt)
