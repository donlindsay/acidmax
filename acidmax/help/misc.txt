This is miscellaenous section of Acidmax help file,that will give you some tips,and problem solving based on FAQ.

First time downloaded Acidmax script.The best way is to exctract all files on your hard drive.Example if your hard drive is C:\ make sure you extract Acidmax in C:\Acidmax2,then start mirc.

If you wish to load some of the theme for Acidmax Default,Zephyr,Cooperdeck,or Gabriel (You  can download those theme from team-nexgen.com scripts section).Type /nexskin goto graphics folder and select theme you wish to use.Acidmax will load it for you.

A good cure to solve these DCC problems is to start with this: 1) Disconnect from your IRC server. 2) Go to File + Setup + Local Info, then Clear the current text in the Local Host and IP Address boxes under File/Setup in the Local_Info dialog. 3) Select both 'On connect, Always get' Local Host and IP Address options in the Local_Info dialog. 4) Set 'Method' to Normal. 5) Leave the Local_Info dialog and the File/Setup menu both with 'OK'. 6) Reconnect to your IRC server.

mIRC can act as an ident server and sends the specified User ID and System as identification. This server will be more useful to some people than others. In general it is better to leave it active as some systems might refuse a connection if there is no reply to an ident request.

To setup Acidmax to show user modes in channel when they talking,goto Commands>Utilities>Event color theme and open setup dialog,on the bottom of the dialog setup characters for ops,voice,and halfops.Acidmax will start displaying those characters beside nickname according to his/hers status.

If you get this message /dll: command locked in options:

If you have timestamps enabled and wish to format them you can do so by typing
//timestamp -f crtl+k14[hh:nntt]ctrl+k
This will change color of your timestamps from white to gray color,or color you choose,also you can make timestamp to have different brackets,that suit your likings.
Note:This will format timestamp for current sesion,next time you start mIRC it`s gonna be back to default,this has nothing to do with Acidmax
it`s just a way how mirc timestamp works.

If your MOTD is not displayed,this is not a Acidmax setting but mIRC setting,to solve this goto:
File > Options > IRC > options
In mIRC 6.1 Goto View > Options > IRC > Options,and uncheck Skip motd on connect checkbox.
