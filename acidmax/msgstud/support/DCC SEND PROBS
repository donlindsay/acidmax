A good cure to solve these DCC problems is to start with this: 1) Disconnect from your IRC server. 2) Go to File + Setup + Local Info, then Clear the current text in the Local Host and IP Address boxes under File/Setup in the Local_Info dialog. 3) Select both 'On connect, Always get' Local Host and IP Address options in the Local_Info dialog. 4) Set 'Method' to Normal. 5) Leave the Local_Info dialog and the File/Setup menu both with 'OK'. 6) Reconnect to your IRC server.
